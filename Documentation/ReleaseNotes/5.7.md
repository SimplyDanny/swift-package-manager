# SwiftPM 5.7 Release Notes


### Package Registry Support

SwiftPM now supports package registry related capabilities introduced by [SE-0292](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0292-package-registry-service.md) and the corresponding [service specification](../Registry.md). With the exception of package publishing, SwiftPM can resolve and download dependencies from any compliant registry using the defined APIs. 

To get started, users will need to specify their package registry by running the `swift package-registry set` subcommand or editing the `registries.json` configuration file. `swift package` tool's `--use-registry-identity-for-scm` and `--replace-scm-with-registry` options might also be of interest.
  
* [SE-0339]

  Module aliases can now be defined in the package manifest to disambiguate between modules with the same name originating from different packages. 

* [#4119] 
 
  Add a `--disable-testable-imports` flag to `swift test` with which tests are built without the testability feature (`import @testable` disabled).
